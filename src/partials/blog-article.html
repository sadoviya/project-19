            Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic
          </p>
          <p class="blog-article-text">
            Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally
            for music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are
            awesome for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as
            great micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive
            sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming
            headphones.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-article-text">
            However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do
            they have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external
            mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.

            A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja,
            famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT
            990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone
            while streaming his games.
